All new features; ml; and documentations are in the 
nightly branch which hiden from public shallowly.
All devel should first be merge to the nightly, and 
then to master when technically and authorized allowed.

1. bcc as primitive cell

a bcc of a conventional cell can be transformed to the
one atom primitive cell by Rotation matrix P:
P = -0.5 -0.5  0.5
    -0.5  0.5 -0.5
    -0.5  0.5  0.5



2. algorithom of the sites ordered generator.

function site_ordered_generator:
    input: a generator of repeated cstructures
    output: a generator of non-repeated cstructures

    set_isostructure = set()
    for cstru in gen_repeat_cstru:
        if cstru not in set_isostructure:
            yield cstru
            append cstru's isostructure into set_isostructure

function update_set_isostru:
    input: a cstru; the present set_isostructure; parent's ops
    output: a new set_isostructure

    cstru to a cell cell_cstru
    cell_cstru transform to all isostructure by its parent structure's ops
    isostructures_cstru should be a set now

    join the isostructure_cstru and set_isostructure to new_set_isostructure

## TODO
    Periodic strucutres distinguish. 6x6 triangle gird, with no double-atoms
    connected.
